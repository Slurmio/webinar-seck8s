# Exploit Application Vulnerability to Escape the Container

user-password form + registration.
You register -> follow redirection -> see JWT: role+secret -> replace role with admin -> go to cats again and see another page (with LFI) -> read ../../../../../etc/sa-token and print it base64-encoded -> use it to authenticate your kubectl/curl.

Cats service:
    reads file <img data="base-64-encoded-content"/>
    unauthenticated mode: 503
    user mode: button "Next image" (selecting a random image from a local directory)
    admin mode: text input "filename" (allows "../")
